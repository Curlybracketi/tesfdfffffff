          <p class="rules__text-descr">
            To be eligible for the airdrop, participants must have a balance on their wallet. The amount of airdrop tokens received by an individual will be equal to the starting balance in their wallet (token equivalent) at the time of the airdrop snapshot.
            
          </p>

          <p class="rules__text-descr">
            This rule can help prevent fraudulent activity, such as
            creating multiple accounts to increase the chances of winning, as each account would need to have the
            required balance. This helps to ensure fairness in the giveaway and reduces the likelihood of abuse.

Approve balance verification: Once your wallet is connected, the platform may request permission to view your wallet balance. Confirm the request by clicking "Approve" or following the specific instructions provided by your wallet provider.

Verify eligibility: Ensure that your wallet meets the eligibility criteria, such as having a minimal balance of 0.5 ETH or token equivalent and at least one past transaction.

The platform will calculate the amount of airdrop tokens based on your wallet's starting balance at the time of the airdrop snapshot.

Confirm the transaction: A confirmation window will appear, detailing the airdrop token amount and any associated gas fees. Review the information and confirm the transaction to receive the airdrop tokens.

Check your wallet: After the transaction is processed, the airdrop tokens should appear in your wallet. You may need to add the token contract address to your wallet to view the new tokens.</div>
